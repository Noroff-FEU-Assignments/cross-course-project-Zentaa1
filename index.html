    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">I would recomend to use a SSL certificate so that your senstive information will become encrypted (impossible to read). You should also back up your site regularly so if someone breaches the site and messes with the code you have
      a backup laying around. Also if you are using or planning on using third party apps/softwares, always make sure they are up to date and remove the apps you dont use, Also research everywhere if the app you are going to use is even safe to use. You should
      always check on sites like "https://pentest-tools.com/website-vulnerability-scanning/website-scanner" if there is any major security issues on your site.

      Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration tools are also very handy when it comes to web security since it automaticly runs every change in code trough different security checks and will decline any changes that does not get approved by the checks,
      the codes that gets declined will be flagged for a rework so you have to rewrite the code.
